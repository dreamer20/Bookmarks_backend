## Bookmark backend

Application where user can keep his bookmarks.

Based on [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi), uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [SQLAlchemy](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy).

Frontend runs here on [GitHub Pages](https://dreamer20.github.io/bookmarks_frontend/).

To test it you can register your own user or just use already registered user by username `test` and password `test1234`.
